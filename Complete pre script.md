## Part1 -- Reinventing The Genre

- Minor Claim

  *Dead Poet Society* is a master piece becuase it subverts the traditional education plot.

- Argument

  1. *Dead Poet Society* has a totally different type of conflict comparing to the traditional education plot. In traditional education plot, for example, *Detachment*, *Good Will Hunting* the protagonist usually plays a role like a teacher or a therapist, facing students who have terrible manner, suffer from their origin famliy's conflict or have physical and mental problems. However, in the *Dead Poet Society* the students are 100% good and competent in study and most of them come from wealthy and educated famliy. From the angle of general public, they are absolutely good students and loyal sons and there is nothing to do with them. However, Mr Keating is totally different from the traditional protagonist in education plot who usually guide students to go back to the normal track. He tries to make them become free thinkers and release their inner passion. He believes that "Human race is filled with passion." The subjects like "medicine, law, business, engineering are noble pursuits and necessary to sustain life.". "But poetry, beauty, romance, love are what we live alive for." He asks his students to do something totally against the tradition. For example, wiping out the lengthy introduction about how to judge a poem just academically without savouring the words and language. He taught them "Gather ye rosebuds while ye may / Old time is still a-flyig / And this same flower that smiles today, tommorow will be dying." "Now in my class, you will learn to think for yourselves again." This kind of behavior is totally unthinkable in the traditional education plot.

  2. Mr Keating also has a different relationship with students. Unlike in the traditional education plot, in which students are students and teachers are teachers, Mr Keating always try to treat the students as friends. We can see the scene like students hold him up to celebrate after a football match or Mr Keating pretend to ignore the students until they call him daringly "Oh captain, my captain.". This kind of relationship is quite unique and can make audience feel refreshed.

- Conclusion

  To sum up, the *Dead Poet Societ* subverts the traditional education plot with different type of conflict and relationship between teacher and students.
