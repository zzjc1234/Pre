## Intro

From the title of the film, we can see that poetry is the soul of this movie. Poetry can help us to "live deep and suck out all the marrow of life." Let's appreciate some examples.

## poem1

*** "O Captain! My Captain!", a poem powerful and emotive, has the most frequent appearance in the film. It is a poem written by Whitman in 1865 to honor President Lincoln after his assassination. The poet used the metaphor of a captain to praise his boundless achievements, and deeply mourn his death. In this film, it captures the students' respect, admiration, loyalty and devotion to Mr. Keating. The phrase becomes a symbol of their bond. ***

## poem2

Wandering how to pick up the lovely girl? Learn this: "Shall I compare thee to a summer's day? Thou art more lovely and more temperate"你的长夏永不凋谢 
And see this one:"She walks in beauty, like the night. Of cloudless climes and starry skies” 像静夜万里无云，繁星满天。 Try them some time bro. Look into the eyes of your girlfriend or the girl you like, recite such lines tenderly, and how can they reject?

## Conclusion

The poems in the film are so beautiful. But to quote Keating, "We don't read and write poetry because it's cute, we read and write poetry because we are members of the human race. And the human race is full of passion."  In the film, you can not only fully appreciate the beauty of poetry and feel the passion of human race.
