## Part1 -- Reinventing The genre

- Argument

    *Dead Poet Society* is a master piece becuase it subverts the traditional education plot. In traditional education plot, the protagonist is usually a teacher, facing bad students or students with physical or mental problems. However, in the *Dead Poet Society* the students are 100% good and competent. Most of them come from wealthy and educated famliy, have talent in knowledge. From the angle of general public, they are absolutely good students and loyal sons.
