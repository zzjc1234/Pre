## Thesis

Dead Poet Society is worth watching because the poems quoted in this movie are both emotionally touching and intellectually inspiring.

## Intro

From the title of the film, we can see that poetry is the soul of this movie. Let's appreciate some examples.

## poem1

"O Captain! My Captain!", a poem powerful and emotive, has the most frequent appearance in the film. The poem captures the students' respect, admiration and loyalty to Mr. Keating. The phrase, borrowed from Whitman's poem, becomes a symbol of their bond.

## poem2

"Seize the day, gather ye rosebuds while ye may" It has a perfect translation in Chinese, 花开堪折直须折。The poem is a beautiful reminder to appreciate the present moment and make the most of our youth and life while we still can.

## poem3

Wandering how to pick up the lovely girl? Learn this: "Shall I compare thee to a summer's day? Thou art more lovely and more temperate"你的长夏永不凋谢 "She walks in beauty, like the night. Of cloudless climes and starry skies” 像静夜万里无云，繁星满天。 Try them some time bro. Look into the eye of your girlfriend or the girl you like, recite such lines tenderly, how can they reject?

## Concl

The poems in the film are so beautiful. But to quote Keating, "We don't read and write poetry because it's cute, we read and write poetry because we are members of the human race. And the human race is full of passion." "Poetry, beauty, romance, love, these are we stay alive for."
