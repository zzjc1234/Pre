# Conclusion

Dead Poets Society is a great movie worth watching because it reinvents the genre, it has wonderful poems and inspiring themes. Poetry can make people become as soft as grass, as delicate as roses, tender as water. It can also make people sharp and edgy like an arrow or steady and resolute like a big tree.

So don't hesitate, let's follow in the footsteps of Mr. Keating,  to enter the world of poetry and embrace a fearless, brilliant youth.
